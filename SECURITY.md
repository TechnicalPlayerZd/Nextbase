## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilites in moderation, there won't be many reviews so think through it carefully.
You would expect to get a review in 10 days
1. If the vulnerability is accepted, then it will be attempted to be solved
2. If the vulnerability is declined, it would be politely, as even if there was an issue, maybe there's a resource allocation priority
